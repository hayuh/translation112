Description:
My project, SmartTranslate, is an educational tool allowing users to manipulate how they would like to translate longer pieces of text, usually paragraphs or entire documents. Users can upload an image of the text to translate, and will then have the option to highlight specific words they want to translate from the long text. Users can also add the words they highlighted for translation into a 20 question quiz game that tests their knowledge on the words.

How to run SmartTranslate:
You should run TPmain.py, which imports TPGame.py. To test the program, hit 'Upload Image', go to the folder titled Codebase, and you should be able to find the images for translation such as 'chinese.png' etc.

Libraries to install:
-pip install PIL
-pip install pytesseract
-pip install googletrans
-pip install matplotlib

Shortcut commands
-Hold down the 'e' key instead of clicking 'Next' if you would like to quickly flip through the quiz game.
